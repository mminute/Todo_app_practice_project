  <h1>My Todos</h1>

  <!--
  So, what does remote: true do for you? In short, it adds a data-remote="true" attribute to the generated html form as seen here, and submits the form via Ajax automagically. As with everything in Rails, there's metaprogramming going on under the hood. In this case, the JavaScript code that we wrote to hijack the submit event and make the appropriate Ajax request is all generated for you behind the scenes. If you're feeling extra curious, check out the Rails.js source code.
